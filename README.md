# PCF Map
A PowerApps PCF control that displays a dataset as pins on Azure Map. Works with any entity that has lat and lon fields

Forked from Jens Schroeders great PCF cluster map control, extended to support more generic scenarios like:

- Configurable base entities: Just specify which entitiy to display as pins, and the fields containing latitude / longitude
- Layer control: Work in progress - choose GeoJSON and SHP file based layers to display on the map by URL
